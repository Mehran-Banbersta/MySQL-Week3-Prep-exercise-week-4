### I decided to embed information in MongoDB based on:
Frequent Access: Embedding data that is frequently queried together for better performance.

Data Size: Embedding smaller, relatively static data like categories and ingredients.

Balance: Striking a balance between normalization and denormalization.

I chose MongoDB for its flexibility, schema-less design, and suitability for semi-structured data.
